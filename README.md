# Cyclist_GDA
It is one of the case studies from the Google Data Analytics Capstone

##### Scenario
You are a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director
of marketing believes the companyâ€™s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore,
your team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights,
your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives
must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data
visualizations.

##  Problem Statement 
Analysing how defferent between casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently; as well as which factors influence the rider to become annual members in order to maximizing the number of annual membership. 

## Preparing

The data can be downloaded on Cyclistic website [link](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html). (Notes: According tothe case study, the datasets have a different name because Cyclistic is a fictional company. The data has been made available by Motivate International Inc. under this [license](https://ride.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement).)

The data is collected monthly by themself, which is reliable, original, and clean. In this case study, I am using the last 12 months from Aug 2021 to Jul 2020.

## Processing
I am using R Studio to clean the data. You can check out the note and code from [script_clearing.R](https://github.com/Cliffsiu/Cyclist_GDA/blob/main/script_clearing.R).

## Analyze
I am using R Studio to clean the data. In this phrase, some calculates are needed:
* The average ride_length for members and casual riders
* The average ride_length for users by day_of_week and month
